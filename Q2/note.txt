Explanation of BEM Naming Convention:

1. Block: Represents a high level component. In this example, the block is 'content'.

2. Element: Represents a part of the block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block. In this example,
 the elements are paragraphs within the content block, denoted as content__paragraph.

3. Modifier: Represents a different state or version of the block or element. Here, modifiers are used to apply different styles to
 the paragraphs. For example:

content__paragraph--primary for the primary paragraph.
content__paragraph--secondary for the secondary paragraph.
content__paragraph--highlight for a highlighted paragraph.
